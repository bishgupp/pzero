Minimal Puppet Format
=====================

Minimal Puppet Format is a stand-alone project for parsing and generating
a simplified form of [Puppet http://puppetlabs.com]'s already simple configuration language.
The differences between this language and the full language is that this
minimal version includes no variables, class constructs, or conditionals of
any kind.

The goal of this project is to provide parsers in non-Ruby languages, and
also to formalize this minimal format.
